# 🌾 Green & White — Automated Agriculture Monitoring & Recommendation System 🤖

> A smart farming solution powered by **IoT**, **AI**, and **Machine Learning** to make agriculture more efficient, sustainable, and profitable 🌱

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
**Green & White** is a precision agriculture system that helps farmers monitor their fields in **real-time** and receive **AI-powered recommendations** for better decision-making.  
It combines **IoT sensors**, **cloud processing**, and **machine learning** to track soil and weather conditions — providing insights to increase yield and reduce waste 🌍

---

## ✨ Key Features
- 📡 **Real-Time Monitoring:** Track soil moisture, temperature, humidity & NPK nutrient levels.  
- 🌾 **Crop Recommendation:** Suggests the most suitable crops based on soil, weather & location.  
- 🐛 **Pest & Disease Alerts:** Detects anomalies or pests using sensors & image recognition.  
- 💧 **Irrigation & Fertilizer Plans:** Provides optimized watering and fertilizer schedules.  
- 📱 **User Dashboard:** Farmers can view data, insights, and expert advice easily.  
- 👨‍💻 **Admin & Expert Portals:** Approve users, validate data, and add suggestions.

## 🔬 Feasibility Study
| Type | Description |
|------|--------------|
| ⚙️ **Technical** | Uses mature sensor tech, robust microcontrollers, and stable communication protocols |
| 💰 **Economic** | Reduces manual labor and improves yield, increasing farmer profit |
| 🧑‍🌾 **Operational** | Simple UI, remote monitoring, scalable system design |

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack
**Frontend:** React.js / Flutter 🌐  
**Backend:** Python (Flask/FastAPI) or Node.js (Express) ⚙️  
**Database:** PostgreSQL / Firebase / MongoDB 🗄️  
**IoT Communication:** MQTT / HTTP API 📡  
**Machine Learning:** scikit-learn / TensorFlow 🧠  
**Cloud Hosting:** AWS / GCP / Azure ☁️  

---

## 🖥️ How It Works
1. 🌱 Farmer registers and enters farm details.  
2. 📶 IoT sensors collect environmental data.  
3. ☁️ Backend stores and processes this data in the cloud.  
4. 🤖 ML model analyzes data for crop and fertilizer recommendations.  
5. 🧑‍🌾 Farmer dashboard displays live stats & suggestions.  
6. ⚠️ Alerts sent for pest/disease risks or critical conditions.
